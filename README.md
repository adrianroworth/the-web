# Skeleton (Bare Bones) - SkBB

This is a project containing the basic requirements for building most static sites. The intention is to have all (or most) of what you need at the ready so that the actual development can begin as soon as possible. This is an on going project that will evolve over time. Striving to cater for any, and all dev situations and contexts.

`Express` - baked in to the routing/controllers
`Handlebars` - can be switched out for templating langauge of your choice.
`MongoDB` - default DB - can be switched on or off.

Have a set up script that asks what templating language you want to use. amongst a miriad of other settings.


views folder path = `/src/views/{layours/pages/partials}`

config folder for all global configurations shared across the project.
